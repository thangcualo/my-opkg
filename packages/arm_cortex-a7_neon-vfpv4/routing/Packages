Description:  alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information
 over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything
 which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv
 visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration
 information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...
 
 alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert
 information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special
 programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes
 care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other
 nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any
 configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
 information available from all alfred servers in the network.
